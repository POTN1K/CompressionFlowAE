# Flow Compression
____
In recent years the amount of data researchers can generate and access skyrocketed. This introduced
a significant variety in the usefulness of the measured data, posing problems of redundancy and com-
putational expense. This project aims to compress two dimensional Kolmogorov type flow data into a
smaller set of features, while preserving the main properties to a suï¬€icient level of accuracy. The results
can contribute to improved flow data storage and flow analysis in a reduced latent space.

This repository is the product of the 3 month Capstone project (TI3150TU), part of the minor Engineering with AI of the TU Delft. The repository contains the FlowCompression module developed by the team, instructional jupyter notebooks, and this readme.
