# Observation:
# - v, u velocity increases but not too much
# - u velocity seems to be creating multiple isolated areas
# - Vorticity goes from negative to positive
# - Energy decreases
# - flow seems becoming more turbulent
# - In vorticity plot, layers become more separated
# - Areas where peak and low energy do not change
# - Flow direction does not change much (arrow plot)
# - v velocity becomes more uniform, u becomes less uniform

# average curl increases, 'angle' of the high and low areas in vorticity plots seems to be increasing
# average energy increases quite readily (disregard end values as outside range of Kolmogorov values as parametrized)
# x velocity becomes 'muddied', no real distinct areas anymore
# y velocity gets more bundled together and higher in magnitude

# Mode 4

# energy follows similar trends as previously seen but: shifts a bit to the left as opposed to the right
# again, vorticity first decreases and then increases, seems to shift to the left as with energy
# again, u becomes more muddied and v becomes more 'together', higher magnitudes.
