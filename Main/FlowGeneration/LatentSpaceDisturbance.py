# Observations:

# MODE 1
# - v, u velocity increases but not too much
# - u velocity seems to be creating multiple isolated areas
# - Vorticity goes from negative to positive
# - Energy decreases
# - flow seems becoming more turbulent
# - In vorticity plot, layers become more separated
# - Areas where peak and low energy do not change
# - Flow direction does not change much (arrow plot)
# - v velocity becomes more uniform, u becomes less uniform

# hierarchical:
# as goes from -1.5 times itself to +1.5:
# y velocity becomes positive where it was negative and neg where it was pos,
# increasingly so at higher parameter magnitudes, shifts right a bit
# x velocity waves move right, don't change in intensity or magnitude or direction


# MODE 2
# Hierarchical:
# takes inverse of y-velocity: shifted right and negative
# reverses orientation of 'waves' in x velocity, but keeps the sign / orientation

# - Energy and curl increases
# - X-velocity polarises: top becomes more negative, bottom becomes more positive
# - Y- velocity remains relatively constant


# MODE 3
# Hierarchical:
# not much change in v velocity at all
# only change in x velocity: generally pos and neg areas are flipped in orientation


# average curl increases, 'angle' of the high and low areas in vorticity plots seems to be increasing
# average energy increases quite readily (disregard end values as outside range of Kolmogorov values as parametrized)
# x velocity becomes 'muddied', no real distinct areas can be spotted
# y velocity gets more bundled together and higher in magnitude


# MODE 4
# hierarchical
# almost no change in y velocity
# pos becomes neg and neg becomes pos in x velocity, wave shapes stays same

# energy follows similar trends as previously seen but: shifts a bit to the left as opposed to the right
# again, vorticity first decreases and then increases, seems to shift to the left as with energy
# again, u becomes more muddied and v becomes more 'together', higher magnitudes.
