    "In this notebook, we will demonstrate how the team conducted the physical analysis of the modes in the latent space. The best performing autoencoder developed by the team possessed four modes in its latent space, and based on this a hierarchical autoencoder was developed utilising the same number of modes in its latent space. Due to its inherent property of producing ordered modes, this latter model is the one that will be used in the present investigation."
