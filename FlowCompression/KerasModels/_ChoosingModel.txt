All models here can be called using create_trained()
The models here introduced are divided in the following way:

- autoencoder_2D, encoder_2D, decoder_2D
    HYPERPARAMETERS:
        dimensions: list[int] = [32, 16, 8, 4], l_rate: float = 0.0005, epochs: int = 200,
        batch: int = 10, early_stopping: int = 10, re: float = 40.0, nx: int = 24, nu: int = 2,
        activation_function: str = 'tanh', pooling: str = 'max', loss: str = 'mse'
    Intermediate model, standard architecture, tuned hyperparameters

- autoencoder_h, encoder_h, decoder_h
    HYPERPARAMETERS:
        dimensions: list[int] = [32, 16, 8, 4], l_rate: float = 0.0005, epochs: int = 50,
        batch: int = 20, early_stopping: int = 10, re: float = 40.0, nx: int = 24, nu: int = 2,
        activation_function: str = 'tanh', pooling: str = 'max', loss: str = 'mse'
    Final model for flow generation and characterization, hierarchical architecture, tuned hyperparameters

- autoencoder_ph, encoder_ph, decoder_ph
    HYPERPARAMETERS:
        dimensions: list[int] = [32, 16, 8, 4], l_rate: float = 0.00001, epochs: int = 100,
        batch: int = 50, early_stopping: int = 10, re: float = 40.0, nx: int = 24, nu: int = 2,
        activation_function: str = 'tanh', pooling: str = 'max', loss: str = 'custom_loss_function'
    Final model for flow compression, standard architecture, trained on top of intermediate model using custom
    loss function, most physical model

Models in StandardDims include tuned models for latent space dimensions from 1 to 64. They were used for plotting
purposes only. There is no function to call them. Refer to create_trained() for a guide.
