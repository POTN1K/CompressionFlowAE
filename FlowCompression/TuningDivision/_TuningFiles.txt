The files in this directory were used for tuning.

iter_1_analysis.csv, uses one velocity component to get a rough estimation of the hyperparameters
iter_2_analysis.csv, creates a more refined tuning still using one component but including accuracy metrics developed
iter_3_analysis.csv, final iteration to find the best hyperparameters for the model, using 2D velocities

AE_metrics.csv, gives relevant information about the tuned models using different latent spaces
POD_metrics.csv, gives information for the number of modes considered when reconstructing the flow
